## Description

This project redesigns the blob’s movement and surrounding environment to express the emotion of panic using p5.js. The blob’s motion becomes erratic and unpredictable, with rapid directional changes, increased wobble, and screen shake to visually communicate anxiety and loss of control. Environmental elements such as pulsing danger zones and a vignette effect further reinforce the feeling of panic and pressure.

As a bonus mechanic, the blob exhibits mischievous behavior within a small map. It can bump movable objects like crates and steal collectible coins when it gets close to them. These interactions make the blob feel more alive and intentional, while also adding playful chaos that aligns with its panicked emotional state.
